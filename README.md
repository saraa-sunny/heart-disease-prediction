# Heart disease risk prediction

## Problem statement 🎯
Heart disease is among the most prevalent and leading cause of death globally.Early diagnosis plays a critical role in patient survival.

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using a classic dataset. The model will analyze various clinical features to classify a patient as either having or not having heart disease.

Dataset:
* Name: Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset
* Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
* Description: The dataset contains 14 features, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, for 303 patients.

### The goal is to predict the target variable, which indicates the presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no).
